# Binary Search Tree (BST) Implementation in Java

This repository contains an implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) in Java. A Binary Search Tree is a node-based data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. The key property of a BST is that the left child of a node contains a value less than the node, and the right child contains a value greater than the node.

## Features
- Insert nodes into the tree
- Search for a node in the tree
- Delete nodes from the tree
- Tree traversal: Inorder, Preorder, and Postorder
- Print the tree structure

## Project Structure
The project consists of two primary files:

1. **Main.java**: The entry point of the program that demonstrates the use of the BST by inserting, deleting, and traversing nodes.
2. **Tree.java**: Implements the Binary Search Tree (BST) with methods for inserting, searching, deleting nodes, and tree traversal (inorder, preorder, and postorder).

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/binary-search-tree.git
   cd binary-search-tree

2. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   javac com/example/Main.java com/example/Tree.java

3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   java com.example.Main
